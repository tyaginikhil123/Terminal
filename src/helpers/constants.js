Here each directory consists of two types of objects :
    1) with .file extension
    2) with .dir extension

Objects with .dir extension are directories which can be accessed
using cd command.
Example : cd about.dir

Objects with .file extension are files, whose content can be 
seen using cat command
Example : cat about.dir

I hope you have a joyful experience :)
